# Autodupes

*I said I wouldn't, but here we are.*

This is a Lambda client plugin. Becuase I was bored.

These 2 Modules are for 5b5t, a server with an intentional dupe.
they patched stacked shulkers, and now stacked shulkers take forever to make.

So Techale made a bypass for it, and kept it in GS++, a private utility mod.

None of the GS++ members really play 5b5t anymore, so I figured just letting people at it isn't a big deal.
